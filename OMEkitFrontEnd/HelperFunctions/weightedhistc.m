% WEIGHTEDHISTC   Weighted histogram count
%
% This function provides a basic equivalent to MATLAB's HISTC function for
% weighted data. 
%
% Usage: h = weightedhistc(vals, weights, edges)
%
% Arguments:
%       vals - vector of values.
%    weights - vector of weights associated with each element in vals.  vals
%              and weights must be vectors of the same length.
%      edges - vector of bin boundaries to be used in the weighted histogram.
%
% Returns:
%        h - The weighted histogram
%            h(k) will count the weighted value vals(i) 
%            if edges(k) <= vals(i) <  edges(k+1).  
%            The last bin will count any values of vals that match
%            edges(end). Values outside the values in edges are not counted. 
%
% Use bar(edges,h) to display histogram
